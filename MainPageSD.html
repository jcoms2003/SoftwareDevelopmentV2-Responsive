                <h3 id="egg1" class="center"> What is software development? </h3>
                <p class="indent"> Software development is a more complex way of saying you work with computer software. Software is all the code and action behind the scenes of every computer. 
                    For example, software is what runs and displays your games, web browsers, smartphones, and medical devices. To break it down even more, you have specific software 
                    that runs applications, operating systems, and calculations. So, basically, as a software engineer you will be working with computers daily. <br>
                    Now that you have a basic understanding of what software is, lets get into the different types of specialties you can delve intoâ€¦<br>
                    Front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.

            <div class="card">
                <h3 id="egg2" class="center"> Front-end Developer </h3>
                <p class="indent"> A front-end developer focuses on the creation and maintenance of websites. 
                    Or, in other words, the part of the program the user sees. You will need to understand markup languages such as HTML and a basic understanding 
                    of other languages. Working with a web browser and debugging tests are also a necessity. Overall, your job will be working on what the user will 
                    see by maintaining it and keeping the speed as efficient as possible. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3 id="egg3" class="center"> Back-end Developer </h3>
                <p class="indent"> As a back-end developer, you will work with what goes on behind the scenes. Programming languages that you should know include Python, C, Java, and Rust. 
                    Understanding servers and how they run is also a skill that is required. In addition, having a basic understanding of front-end skills is essential. 
                    This is necessary because you will be working regularly with the front-end and you need to know how your back-end code will affect the output of the webpage.

                <h3 id="egg4" class="center"> Cyber Security Professional </h3>
                <p class="indent"> 
                    As a cyber security professional, you could work in two different areas. The first is known as the red team. Red team individuals work as professional hackers 
                    that specialize in social engineering, penetration testing, card cloning, and making recommendations for blue team to make security improvements. Now, the blue 
                    team is basically the opposite of the red team. They are the defensive line and protect against cyber-attacks. Blue team members specialize in digital forensics, 
                    DNS audits, and installing and configuring firewalls and endpoint security software. Skills required for this type of job include a strong understanding of networking 
                    and data flow within computer systems. Certifications that are also needed include CompTIA Security+ and a few others you can find at <a href="https://www.coursera.org/articles/red-team-vs-blue-team"> Coursera.org</a>.

                <p> 
                    Software development is a fast growing industry that is one of the highest paying jobs and does not even require a degree? 
                    In fact, most entry software developers started by just playing with code which led to certification; and that is all you need to get started!
